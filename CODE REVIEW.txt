OPEN REVIEW REQUESTS: 
*Example* Hi David, could you please review the following two files for me? (Date requested: 2/8/19)
"C:\Users\elineb\Documents\gf\resource_tracking\prep\global_fund_prep\gos\prep_gos_data.R"
"C:\Users\elineb\Documents\gf\resource_tracking\miscellaneous\graph_ghe_using_sicoin.r"

Anyone - please review the (messy!) prep code I wrote for the outputs/activities data going into the impact
model... I'm not sure if some of the messy code can be shortened, or if some of it just is the way it is.  Also,
one thing I struggle with is constantly aggregating to different geographic/temporal levels. I started working on a 
combination dataset with SNIS and PNLP at the lowest levels, with all the data to have it be more like the resource 
tracking data, but that was after I wrote this code.  Anyways, it's here:
.\gf\impact_evaluation\2b_prep_activities_outputs.r
