#### **Unique identifiers**  
   The unique identifiers for the observations in this data are health zone, date (month and year), indicator, and subpopulation.

#### **Where to find the code and data**  
   The code can be found on github, [here](https://github.com/ihmeuw/gf/tree/develop/outcome_measurement/malaria/cod), and the data can be found on Basecamp in DRC PCE / Docs & Files / Outcome Measurement data / National Malaria Program / Prepped Data, [here](https://3.basecamp.com/3769859/buckets/4025874/vaults/1131529751).
