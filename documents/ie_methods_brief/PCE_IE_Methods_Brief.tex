% Overview
\section{Purpose of this Document}
The purpose of this document is twofold:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To explain, in advance, the analytical approach which we have selected for impact evaluation, with the goals of methods improvement through feedback, transparency, and formal demonstration of the robustness (both strengths and limitations) of the methods. There are many aspects of this approach which I believe are as robust as possible, although the overall study design is weak.
  \item To lay out a "road map" of how we can accomplish a task as daunting as an impact evaluation of the Global Fund in 2 years. To detail (more) precisely how this can be done.
\end{enumerate}


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Overview
\section{Overview}
% it's mosty just measuring lots of indicators
The basic approach to this impact evaluation is simply to measure many separate indicators, then measure their correlation. Through impact evaluation frameworks (i.e. "results chains") and thematic frameworks, those indicators (and more) are outlined in specific detail. The remainder of the impact evaluation is to identify the appropriate indicators measure correlation between, and do so while controlling for confounding. \\

% majority of effort is to ensure that our data produce a valid measure of the quantity of interest
The majority of the complexity and effort required to accomplish this task is to ensure that the data we use actually produce a valid measure of the quantity of interest. Techniques such as data triangulation (see Section \ref{triangulation}), model-based geostatistics (see Section \ref{mbg}), outlier detection and multiple imputation (see Section \ref{data_processing}), will be applied selectively to enhance that measurement validity. \\

% controls are critical for the impact analysis. some are hard to come by like non-GF expenditure, some will have stronger correlation with GF expenditure than the output itself because endogeneity
The controls are especially critical for the impact analysis (see Section \ref{hypothesis}). Some other variables are expected to have a stronger correlation with both expenditure and outputs than the correlation between expenditure and outputs itself, and without careful attention to them, this analysis will fail to measure what it intends to measure. \\

Finally, it is essential that the indicators are measured independently. That is to say that the measurement approach for a specific indicator does not use any of its preceding indicators (in the results chain) in the process. This helps ensure that the correlations measured between indicators are reflective of the theorized causal pathways, not endogeneity in measurement.

% Hypothesis Being Tested
\section{Hypothesis Being Tested} \label{hypothesis}

% that changes in global fund investments result in observable changes in outputs, and that those changes in outputs result in observable changes in coverage and, subsequently burden of disease
The core hypothesis of this impact evaluation is that changes in Global Fund investments result in observable changes in health systems outputs. Additionally, the hypothesis is that those changes in outputs result in observable changes in intervention coverage, which subsequently results in improvements in burden of disease. \\

% that conditional on need, Global Fund investments are exogenous
We assume that, conditional on need, Global Fund investments are exogenous to health systems outputs. In other words, we assume that investments are targeted towards interventions and areas with unmet need, and that apart from decision-making about where there is need for investment, health systems outputs are only affected by Global Fund investment and do not affect it. Need, in this context can be defined as burden of disease without proportionate spending by other financing sources. \\

% how confounding is expected to work

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Basic Outputs Model
\section{Basic Outputs Model}

% the form of the model
The central model for measuring the contribution of Global Fund inputs to health systems outputs is a linear model. The precise functional form of the model will be selected to be fit for purpose given the distribution of the output data. In theory, the characteristics of typical output data are that they are integer (whole numbers), over-disbursed (requiring both a mean and variance parameter to describe their distribution), heteroskedastic (different variance at different levels of a given explanatory variable), and temporally-autocorrelated (similar to itself in previous time points). For these reasons, the model is (arguably) most appropriately fit as a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) in the negative binomial family. For simplicity, I will avoid model notation that explicitly represents a negative binomial GLMM, in order to focus attention on the variables and the level at which they're measured (indexed). \\

% principle of the model
Measurement of the Global Fund contribution to outputs will rely on the co-variance of outputs and expenditure along three dimensions: space, time and activity. In other words, investments by the Global Fund focus on different interventions in different places, and change from year to year, and so do outputs. If the hypothesis being tested is correct, we would expect to observe changes in health systems outputs that coincide with changes in investments along those three dimensions. As noted already, that coincidence alone is not expected to reflect the Global Fund's contribution, but rather the coincidence that happened apart from the correlation that other resources and burden of disease have with outputs. That implies the following regression:

% the model
\begin{equation} \label{basic_model}
O_{jti} = \beta_1 E^{gf}_{jti} + \beta_2 E^{\neg gf}_{jti} + \beta_3 I_{jt}
\end{equation}

% explanation of notation
In this formula, $j$ indexes subnational areas (provinces/ departments, districts/municipalities or otherwise), $t$ indexes time (years, quarters, or months) and $i$ indexes intervention categories, defined by the Modular Framework. $O$, represents counts of health systems outputs, $E$ represents expenditure either by the Global Fund ($^{gf}$) or other sources ($^{\neg gf}$), and $I$ represents incidence of the disease for which interventions were designed. The $\beta$ terms are coefficients (correlations) to be estimated from the data using maximum likelihood estimation. This model will primarily be fit separately by disease.\\

% interpretation
The coefficient $\beta_1$ therefore measures the correlation between Global Fund investment and outputs, controlling for other investments and disease burden. Under the assumptions of the Theory of Change and Impact Frameworks (detailed elsewhere), this correlation represents the contribution of the Global Fund to those outputs. \\

% extension to RSSH
\subsection{Extension to RSSH}
In evaluating the contribution of catalytic and system-wide Global Fund investments (such as investments to strengthen resilient and sustainable systems for health, abbreviated RSSH), an additional layer of controls may be necessary. This is because such investments are intended to operate in addition to, or synergistically with, other program areas, not to result in outputs on their own.[CITE] % CITATION NEEDED
 Essentially, this amounts to controlling for Global Fund spending from programs other than just RSSH as well:

% RSSH model
% \begin{equation}
  \begin{align}
    O_{jti} = \beta_1 E^{^{RSSH}}_{jti} + \beta_1 E^{^{HIV/TB/Malaria}}_{jti} \\
    + \beta_2 E^{\neg gf}_{jti} + \beta_3 I_{jt}
  \end{align}
% \end{equation}

% note about using budget as an ITT
\textit{Technical Note: Although expenditure from the Global Fund is the intervention of interest, the above model will also be explored using the planned budget as a proxy for expenditure. The rationale for doing so is to avoid potential bias from differential absorption. Similar to the "intent to treat" principle from a randomized control trial, the drivers of actual execution of funds are more diverse and poorly-understood than the drivers of planned budgeting, and thus more challenging to control. To measure the correlation between actual expenditure and outputs would also be to measure the contribution of those absorption-driving factors, and would weaken the interpretability of the coefficient of interest. While both budget and expenditure will be explord, budget will be considered the primary explanatory variable. \\}

\section{Relationship with Value for Money} \label{vfm}
The basic outputs model has a natural relationship with value for money (VfM) assessment. As defined by the Global Fund Monitoring and Evaluation team, the key metric of VfM is cost per output, or cost per case averted. [CITE] \\
% CITATION: Briefing
% Strategic Information Department Briefing
% 2017-2022 Strategic KPI Framework Performance targets for KPIs 1, 2 & 8
% March 2018. The Global Fund

The definition of the coefficient $\beta_1$ in formula \ref{basic_model} is the average observed increase in outputs per unit increase in expenditure. $\beta_1$ is also simply stated as the inverse of cost per output (i.e. $cost\, per\, output = 1/\beta_1$). In this way, the core model for impact evaluation is the same as the core model for VfM assessment. \\

Additional interpretation of the impact evaluation model is the key to using it for VfM assessment. As allocation efficiency is among the critical topics for evaluation, estimates from the core model can be produced among counterfactual scenarios, comparing alternate mixes of interventions and their expected relationship with output.\\

% Further Details on Resource Tracking
\section{Further Details on Resource Tracking} \label{resource_tracking}

\subsection{Purely Systematic Model}

\begin{equation} \label{rt_model1}
\widehat{E_{jti}}=E_{jtm}*\frac{E_{ti}}{E_{tm}}
\end{equation}

Where $E$ represents investment from any source ($\hat{E}$ being an estimate of $E$) and $m$ indexes modules (from the Modular Framework), within which interventions are nested (in a collectively-exhaustive way). The fraction $\frac{E_{ti}}{E_{tm}}$ is computed \textit{by module}, such that the sum of this fraction across the interventions of a single module is \%100 ($\sum \frac{E_{ti_{m\in M}}}{E_{tm=M}}=1$). The purpose of this approach is to utilize data sources with different strengths in combination. The PCE Inception Phase uncovered that certain country-level data sources often contain a high level of detail about subnational areas ($j$), but little detail about interventions, typically only the corresponding modules ($m$). global-level data sources however often offer a high level of detail about interventions ($i$), but little, if any, detail about subnational areas. Hence, the fraction in equation \ref{rt_model1} can be accurately measured using global-level data, while $E_{jtm}$ can be accurately measured using country-level data. By combining the two, we estimate the details of interventions within subnational areas.\\

This approach relies on the assumption that investment is allocated with the same proportions within each module at every subnational area. This is likely untrue. One approach toward relaxing this assumption is to attempt to break down the fraction $\frac{E_{ti}}{E_{tm}}$ (i.e. the global-level data) into subnational areas as well, defined by the geographic regions covered by sub-recipients. In this way, the fraction in equation \ref{rt_model1} can be computed specific to broad geographic areas at the least, allowing a more geographically-precise apportioning of interventions within modules.

\subsection{Stochastic, Cost-Based Model}

\begin{align}
  D_{jti} * \widehat{C_i} = \beta_1 E_{jtm} + \beta_2 E_{ti} + \epsilon
  % or should it be this?
  % D_{jti} = \beta_1 E_{jtm} + \beta_2 E_{ti} + \epsilon \\
  % \widehat{E_{jti}} = \widehat{D_{jti}} * \widehat{C_i}
\end{align}

As in the previous section, $E_{jtm}$ is a quantity that can be measured from country-level data sources, and $E_{ti}$ can be measured from global-level data sources. The two of these can be thought of as strong predictors of the distribution of commodities $D_{jti}$, which is measurable through other data sources and can also be indexed by intervention $i$. By multiplying the estimated unit cost of a commodity ($\widehat{C_i}$) by the distribution of that commodity, the fitted values from regression formula are an estimator of the quantity of interest, $\widehat{E_{jti}}$. \\
